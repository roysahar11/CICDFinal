# CICD Final Exercise

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and AWS. It provisions an EC2 instance, builds a Docker image for a Minecraft server, and deploys itâ€”all automated via Jenkins.

## Overview

- **Jenkins Pipeline:**  
  - **GitHub Repo:** Clones the content of this repository.  
  - **Ansible Execution:** Runs a playbook to provision AWS infrastructure and deploy the minecraft server app as a docker container.

- **Ansible Playbook (`ansible/create-infra.yml`):**  
  - Provisions an EC2 instance on AWS.  
  - On the created EC2 instance: installs Docker, clones the repo, builds and pushes a Docker image to AWS ECR, and starts the container.

- **Dockerfile:**  
  - Based on Alpine Linux with OpenJDK 21.  
  - Copies the necessary files packaged in the `app` directory and runs a Minecraft Java server.

- **DockerCompose**
  - Builds the minecraft_server image
  - starts a service "minecraft_server", attaches a volume, and expose port 25565 (The default Mineceafr port)

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with proper IAM permissions, VPC, subnet, and security group setup.
- a Jenkins server configured with Git, Ansible, and Docker plugins.
- Ansible, Docker, and AWS CLI installed on the server that hosts Jenkins.
- aws credentials stored in a profile at _~/.aws/credentials_

## Setup

1. **AWS Configuration:**  
   Update `ansible/create-infra.yml` with your AWS credentials profile, key pair, subnet, security group, and AMI details.

2. **Jenkins:**  
   Create a pipeline job that uses the provided `Jenkinsfile`.

3. **Deployment:**  
   The pipeline provisions the infrastructure, builds the Docker image, pushes it to AWS ECR, and starts the Minecraft server container.
